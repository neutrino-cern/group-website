short_description: "SND@LHC aims at exploring High-Energy Neutrinos at the Large Hadron Collider"
description: "SND@LHC is a neutrino scattering experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, operational since 2022. Located 480 meters downstream of the ATLAS interaction point, it features an 800 kg tungsten target combined with emulsion and electronic trackers. The experiment detects all three neutrino flavors in the high-energy range of 100 GeV to 1 TeV, exploring an unexplored pseudo-rapidity region. It provides new insights into heavy-flavor production and high-energy atmospheric neutrinos. Additionally, SND@LHC searches for Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs), complementing indirect searches at other detectors."
long_description: "Located 480 m downstream of IP1 in the unused TI18 tunnel, this detector is a hybrid system consisting of  an 800 kg target mass of tungsten plates, interleaved with emulsion and electronic trackers, followed downstream by a calorimeter and a muon system. This configuration allows identification and measurement of all three flavours of neutrinos produced in LHC proton-proton collisions. These are the highest-energy laboratory-produced neutrinos, with energies in the unexplored range between 100 GeV and 1 TeV. Moreover, the detector is placed close to the beam axis, in an unexplored pseudo-rapidity range of 7.2 -8.4 gives access to a large fraction of neutrinos originating from charmed-hadron decays. 
Neutrinos detected in the unique forward region of SND@LHC are a probe for heavy-flavour production in a region currently inaccessible to the other LHC experiments like ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.  Also, studying these high energy neutrinos is of  particular interest for future circular colliders and for predictions of very high-energy atmospheric neutrinos. Lastly, the detector is also sensitive to Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) through scattering off nuclei and electrons in the detector target. The direct-search strategy gives the experiment sensitivity in a region of the FIP mass-coupling parameter space that is complementary to other indirect searches.
