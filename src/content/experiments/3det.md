short_description: "3DET aims at revolutionizing neutrino detector manufacturing with 3D Printing"
description: "The 3DET collaboration simplifies the production of finely granulated scintillator detectors by leveraging 3D printing technology. Traditional detectors require millions of meticulously aligned miniature cubes, each threaded with optical fibers to transport scintillation light. 3DET's innovation involves simultaneously 3D-printing large \"super cubes\" with pre-formed optically separated voxels, leaving space for fiber insertion. This approach significantly reduces manufacturing complexity while maintaining high detector performance. The method represents a breakthrough in scalable detector production for advanced neutrino experiments."
long_description: "State-of-the-art neutrino detectors are required to be very finely granulated in order to observe even low energy particles produced in neutrino interactions. A popular choice of technology are scintillator detectors. In these detectors particles produced in neutrino interactions produce light via a chemical process called scintillation that are then transported to photosensors via optical fibres. To achieve a fine granularity, state-of-the-art detectors are built of optically-separated miniature cubes which can be as small as 1cmË†3. For example, T2K's recent upgrade of its ND280 detector is built from 2 million of such cubes with fibres carefully threaded through small holes within them in three directions. These detectors are highly performant, but are very challenging to build simply because of the challenges in aligning so many small holes across so many small cubes. Moreover, each of the cubes has to be individually manufactured. 3DET has developed a method of simultaneously 3D printing with multiple materials (some for the scintillator, some for the opaque layer to keep cubes optically separated) to produce not individual small cubes, but a large super-cube made of many optically separated voxels. In their latest work, they also leave space for the insertion of the optical fibres in each voxel, making the detector manufacturing process extremely simple."
