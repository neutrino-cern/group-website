description: "nuSCOPE is a collaboration formed as a result of the merging of the ENUBET and NuTag collaborations. The collaboration is investigating the physics potential and feasibility of a short-baseline neutrino beam experiment at CERN, using a monitored and tagged neutrino beam. Thanks to its unprecedented control over the neutrino flux, such a facility is uniquely positioned to perform precise measurements of neutrino-nucleus scattering processes, thus tackling the main source of systematic uncertainty for future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments."
