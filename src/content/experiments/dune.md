short_description: "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation neutrino oscillation experiment."
description: "The near detector of the experiment will be situated in Fermilab, near Chicago, USA, 
with the neutrinos travelling over 1300km until they reach the far detector in the Sanford Underground Research Facility, in Lead, South Dakota. The experiment will be able to measure the properties of neutrinos with unprecedented precision."
