short_description: "ProtoDUNE aims at pioneering Liquid Argon detector technologies for DUNE"
description: "ProtoDUNE at CERN is a critical prototype for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), operating as a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LAr TPC). It tests and optimizes technologies for DUNE's far detectors, advancing high-precision studies of neutrino interactions. The experiment explores fundamental questions like neutrino mass hierarchy, CP violation, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Research efforts include detector calibration, advanced data acquisition, and computational algorithms for event reconstruction. Collaborative work with global partners drives innovations in neutrino research."
long_description: "It is a critical prototype for developing and testing the technologies and methodologies for the DUNE's far detectors. ProtoDUNE operates as a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LAr TPC), a sophisticated apparatus designed to study the interactions of neutrinos, fundamental particles with minimal interaction with matter.
Research at ProtoDUNE is pivotal in advancing the field of neutrino physics. Despite being the most abundant fermions in the universe, Neutrinos remain poorly understood due to their weak interaction with other matters. Through ProtoDUNE, we aim to explore key questions in particle physics and cosmology, such as the nature of neutrino mass hierarchy, charge-parity (CP) violation in the lepton sector, and the potential for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Understanding neutrino properties is essential for explaining phenomena like matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.
The research group at CERN focuses on several core areas within the ProtoDUNE framework. We are involved in the design, calibration, and optimization of the LAr TPC, ensuring high-precision measurements of neutrino interactions. The group develops advanced data acquisition systems and computational algorithms for signal processing and event reconstruction. The approach combines experimental physics with theoretical modeling, leveraging Monte Carlo simulations and machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret the data. Collaborative efforts with international partners are crucial for advancing the technology and methodology used in neutrino research.
